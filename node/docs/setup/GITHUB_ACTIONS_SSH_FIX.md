# üîê GitHub Actions SSH Authentication Fix

## Problem Identified
GitHub Actions was failing with: `ssh.ParsePrivateKey: ssh: no key found`

## Solution

### 1. New SSH Key Generated
Created a new ED25519 SSH key specifically for GitHub Actions:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/github_deploy -N "" -C "github-actions@deploy"
```

### 2. Update GitHub Secret

**IMPORTANT**: You need to update the `SERVER_SSH_KEY` secret in GitHub:

1. Go to: https://github.com/marcosbondrpc/solana2/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click on `SERVER_SSH_KEY` 
3. Click "Update secret"
4. **Copy the ENTIRE private key content** (including the BEGIN and END lines):

```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZW
QyNTUxOQAAACDxOq68c5wPmfJw0U3h7zf2ENo6kx0QwRjJJMA7DTa1xQAAAJgxcCMHMXAj
BwAAAAtzc2gtZWQyNTUxOQAAACDxOq68c5wPmfJw0U3h7zf2ENo6kx0QwRjJJMA7DTa1xQ
AAAECPPrnz7kO3EL4jU/nKsw/BVUtHJrsyskDG5VXCy0M01fE6rrxznA+Z8nDRTeHvN/YQ
2jqTHRDBGMkkwDsNNrXFAAAAFWdpdGh1Yi1hY3Rpb25zQGRlcGxveQ==
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

5. Click "Update secret"

### 3. Key Features
- **Type**: ED25519 (more secure and efficient than RSA)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated for GitHub Actions deployment
- **Location**: `~/.ssh/github_deploy` on server
- **Authorized**: Added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

### 4. Workflow Configuration
The workflow is configured to use:
- **Action Version**: `appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.3`
- **Port**: 22 (as integer, not string)
- **Host**: 45.157.234.184
- **Username**: kidgordones

## Testing

After updating the GitHub secret:

1. **Trigger a test deployment**:
   - Push any commit to main branch
   - Or manually trigger the workflow from Actions tab

2. **Monitor the logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f /home/kidgordones/0solana/node/sync.log
   ```

3. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/marcosbondrpc/solana2/actions
   - Look for green checkmarks

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Failing

1. **Verify the secret was updated correctly**:
   - The entire key must be copied (including header/footer)
   - No extra spaces or line breaks

2. **Test SSH connectivity locally**:
   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_deploy kidgordones@45.157.234.184 "echo 'SSH OK'"
   ```

3. **Check server logs**:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u ssh -f
   ```

### Alternative Approach

If issues persist, we can switch to using GitHub's deployment keys:

1. Add the public key as a deployment key in the repo
2. Use GitHub's built-in deployment mechanisms
3. Or use a GitHub App for authentication

## Security Notes

- The private key is only stored in GitHub Secrets (encrypted)
- The public key is in server's authorized_keys
- Key is dedicated for GitHub Actions only
- Can be revoked by removing from authorized_keys
