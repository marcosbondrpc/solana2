## 💎 Core Innovations

### 1. NanoBurst QUIC Congestion Control

Custom congestion controller specifically designed for MEV, prioritizing **time-to-first-land** over throughput.

```rust
// Ultra-aggressive MEV-optimized congestion control
struct NanoBurst {
    window: 24 packets,        // Minimal inflight
    rtt: 1.6ms,               // Optimistic initialization
    bias: time-to-first-land  // Not throughput
}
```

**Key Features:**
- 24 packet maximum window (vs 64+ standard)
- Loss-aware pacing with EWMA tracking
- Optimistic 1.6ms RTT initialization
- Aggressive retransmission on loss
- MEV-specific window adjustment

### 2. Dual-Path Submission System

Simultaneous submission to both direct TPU and Jito Block Engine with intelligent routing.

```rust
// Adaptive path selection based on real-time metrics
enum SubmissionPath {
    DirectTPU,      // <1ms latency
    JitoEngine,     // Higher land rate
    Both            // Critical opportunities
}
```

**Features:**
- Lock-free SPSC rings for sign+send pipeline
- Adaptive tip calculation: `α * value + β(load)`
- Dynamic path selection based on success rates
- Priority-based routing (UltraHigh → Low)

### 3. Hardware-Level Optimizations

#### Kernel Bypass (io_uring)
```rust
// Zero-copy packet reception with kernel bypass
- SQPOLL mode for automatic submission
- Registered buffers for zero-copy
- Batch operations (64 packets/call)
- <10μs kernel interaction
```

#### SIMD Feature Extraction
```rust
// AVX512-optimized calculations
- Price delta computation
- Volume aggregation
- Slippage calculation
- 16x parallel processing
```

#### Hardware Timestamping
```c
// Nanosecond precision with SO_TIMESTAMPING
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_RX_HARDWARE  // NIC RX timestamp
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_HARDWARE  // NIC TX timestamp
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_RAW_HARDWARE // Raw hardware time
```

### 4. Lock-Free Zero-Copy Pipeline

```
UDP RX → Decode → Filter → Features → ML → Decision → Bundle → Send
  ↓        ↓        ↓         ↓        ↓       ↓         ↓        ↓
SPSC    SPSC     SPSC      SPSC    SPSC    SPSC      SPSC    SPSC
Ring    Ring     Ring      Ring    Ring    Ring      Ring    Ring
```

**Characteristics:**
- Zero allocations in hot path
- Pre-allocated memory pools
- Lock-free SPSC rings (4096 slots)
- Per-module isolation (Arb/Sandwich)
- Batch processing where possible
