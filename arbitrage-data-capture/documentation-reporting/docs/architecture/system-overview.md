## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer

The data ingestion layer is responsible for collecting real-time blockchain and mempool data from multiple sources.

```python
def detect_arbitrage_cycles(graph, start_vertex):
    """
    Detects negative cycles (arbitrage opportunities) using modified Bellman-Ford
    Time Complexity: O(V*E) where V = vertices (tokens), E = edges (pairs)
    """
    distances = {v: float('inf') for v in graph.vertices}
    distances[start_vertex] = 0
    predecessor = {v: None for v in graph.vertices}
    
    # Relax edges V-1 times
    for _ in range(len(graph.vertices) - 1):
        for u, v, weight in graph.edges:
            if distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distances[u] + weight
                predecessor[v] = u
    
    # Check for negative cycles
    negative_cycles = []
    for u, v, weight in graph.edges:
        if distances[u] + weight < distances[v]:
            # Negative cycle detected
            cycle = extract_cycle(predecessor, v)
            profit = calculate_profit(cycle)
            negative_cycles.append((cycle, profit))
    
    return negative_cycles
```

### 3. Machine Learning Pipeline

The ML pipeline provides predictive capabilities for opportunity identification and success probability estimation.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Training Pipeline"
        HD[Historical Data]
        FE[Feature Engineering]
        MT[Model Training]
        EV[Evaluation]
        DP[Deployment]
    end
    
    subgraph "Inference Pipeline"
        RT[Real-time Features]
        PP[Preprocessing]
        IN[Inference]

    participant E as Executor
    participant F as Flashloan Provider
    participant DEX1
    participant DEX2
    participant B as Blockchain
    
    D->>E: Opportunity Detected
    E->>E: Calculate Optimal Route
    E->>F: Request Flashloan
    F->>E: Provide Funds
    E->>DEX1: Swap Token A -> B
    DEX1->>E: Return Token B

```

#### Smart Contract Architecture:

```solidity
contract ArbitrageExecutor {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    
    // Gas-optimized storage layout
    uint256 private constant FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM = 9; // 0.09%
    address private immutable WETH;
    IFlashLoanProvider private immutable flashLoanProvider;
    
    // Packed struct for gas efficiency
    struct ArbitrageParams {
        address tokenIn;
        address tokenOut;
        uint128 amountIn;
        uint128 expectedProfit;
        address[] routers;
        bytes routerCalldata;
    }
    
    function executeArbitrage(ArbitrageParams calldata params) external {
        // Implementation with assembly optimizations
        assembly {
            // Direct memory operations for gas savings
        }
    }
}
```

        PA[Parquet Files]
    end
    
    RD --> CH
    CH --> S3
    ME --> TS
    TS --> PA
```
