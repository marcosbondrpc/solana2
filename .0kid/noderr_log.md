SystemInitialization | 2025-08-17T03:27:03.488Z | /home/kidgordones/0solana/solana2
PrimaryGoal: Create a production-ready Next.js 14 + TypeScript dashboard in `/home/kidgordones/0solana/solana2/frontend2` that connects to FastAPI + Kafka/ClickHouse/Redis using protobuf-first binary real-time streams (WS/WebTransport), worker-based decoding, zstd (WASM) decompression, and provides operator controls for arbitrage and MEV sandwich modules, datasets, model training/hot-reload, routing/bandit tuning, and SLO guardrails. Target 60 FPS rendering with minimal main-thread CPU, virtualized tables, uPlot charts, and role-guarded actions.
BaselineAssumptions:
- Next.js 14 app-router
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI + shadcn/ui
- Zustand for client state
- uPlot for charts
- protobufjs/ts-proto for protobuf
- zstddec-wasm for decompression
- WebSockets/WebTransport
- Web Workers with coalescing

# Noderr - Operational Record

**Purpose:** This document serves two primary functions for Noderr:
1.  **Operational Log**: A chronological, structured record of significant events, decisions, verification outcomes, and artifact changes during the project lifecycle. Maintained by the AI Agent as per `noderr_loop.md`.
2.  **Reference Quality Criteria**: A standard list of code quality principles referenced during ARC (Attentive Review & Compliance)-Based Verification.

## Section 1: Operational Log

**(Instructions for AI Agent: New entries are to be PREPENDED to this section. Use the file modification command specified in your `environment_context.md`. Each entry MUST be separated by `---`, and its `Timestamp` MUST be generated using the timestamp command from your `environment_context.md`.)**

## Section 2: Reference Quality Criteria (ARC-Based Verification)

**(Instructions for AI Agent: This section is read-only. Refer to these criteria during the "ARC-Based Verification" step (Step 6) and the "ARC-Principle-Based Planning" step (Step 4) as outlined in `noderr_loop.md`. Specific project priorities are set in `noderr_project.md`.)**

### Core Quality Criteria
1.  **Maintainability:** Ease of modification, clarity of code and design, quality of documentation (specs, code comments), low coupling, high cohesion.
2.  **Reliability:** Robustness of error handling, fault tolerance, stability under expected load, data integrity.
3.  **Testability:** Adequacy of unit test coverage (especially for core logic), ease of integration testing, clear separation of concerns enabling testing.
4.  **Performance:** Responsiveness, efficiency in resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) appropriate to project requirements.
5.  **Security:** Resistance to common vulnerabilities (as applicable to project type), secure authentication/authorization, protection of sensitive data, secure handling of inputs.

### Structural Criteria
6.  **Readability:** Code clarity, adherence to naming conventions (from `noderr_project.md`), consistent formatting, quality and necessity of comments.
7.  **Complexity Management:** Avoidance of overly complex logic (e.g., low cyclomatic/cognitive complexity), manageable size of functions/methods/classes.
8.  **Modularity:** Adherence to Single Responsibility Principle, clear interfaces between components, appropriate use of abstraction.
9.  **Code Duplication (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself):** Minimization of redundant code through effective use of functions, classes, or modules.
10. **Standards Compliance:** Adherence to language best practices, project-defined coding standards (from `noderr_project.md`), and platform conventions (from `environment_context.md`).

### Functional Criteria (Primarily verified via `specs/[NodeID].md` ARC Verification Criteria)
11. **Completeness:** All specified requirements in `specs/[NodeID].md` are met.
12. **Correctness:** The implemented functionality behaves as specified in `specs/[NodeID].md` under various conditions.
13. **Effective Error Handling:** As defined in specs, errors are handled gracefully, appropriate feedback is provided, and the system remains stable.
14. **Dependency Management:** Correct versions of libraries (from `noderr_project.md`) are used; unnecessary dependencies are avoided.

### Operational Criteria
15. **Configuration Management:** Proper use of environment variables for sensitive data; configurations are clear and manageable.
16. **Resource Usage:** Efficient use of environment resources. Code is written considering the target execution environment.
17. **API Design (If applicable):** Consistency, usability, and clear contracts for any APIs developed or consumed by the node.

*(This list guides the ARC-Based Verification process. The ARC Verification Criteria within each `specs/[NodeID].md` file provide specific, testable points derived from these general principles and the node's requirements.)*
