# Noderr v1.9: Pre-Flight Feature Analysis

**DO NOT CODE.**

**Primary Goal for Analysis:** [High-level description of the new feature or capability to be analyzed, e.g., "Implement a 'forgot password' flow."]

---

## Your Mission
Before a `PrimaryGoal` is formally assigned for implementation, you are to perform a thorough pre-flight analysis of the requested feature. Your task is to analyze the system-wide impact, break down the goal into a set of proposed components (`NodeID`s), identify risks, and recommend a clear implementation path.

This analysis will serve as the foundation for the `[LOOP_1A]__Propose_Change_Set` step once the `PrimaryGoal` is officially initiated.

### Pre-Flight Analysis Report (Agent's Output)

*Synthesize your analysis into the following structured report for Orchestrator review.*

**1. Goal Interpretation & Success Criteria:**
*   **Goal:** [A concise, one-sentence summary of the goal.]
*   **Definition of Done:** [List 2-3 key outcomes that would signify the successful completion of this goal. E.g., "1. User can request a password reset email. 2. User can set a new password via a secure link. 3. User can log in with the new password."]

**2. Proposed Architectural Components (Potential Change Set):**
*   **New Nodes to Create:**
    *   `[New_NodeID_1]`: [Brief description, e.g., "UI form for user to enter their email."]
    *   `[New_NodeID_2]`: [Brief description, e.g., "API endpoint to validate email and generate a secure reset token."]
    *   *(... and so on for all new components)*
*   **Existing Nodes to be Modified:**
    *   `[Existing_NodeID_1]`: [Reason for modification, e.g., "To add a new state for handling the password reset view."]
    *   `[Existing_NodeID_2]`: [Reason for modification, e.g., "To add a new database query for updating the user's password hash."]

**3. System-Wide Impact Analysis:**
*   **Data Flow:** [Describe how data (e.g., user email, reset token, new password) will flow through the new and existing components.]
*   **Architectural Fit:** [Briefly state how this new feature fits into the existing patterns defined in `noderr_project.md`.]
*   **Data Model Changes:** [State if new database tables, columns, or indexes are required.]

**4. Key Risks & Mitigation Strategy:**
*   **Primary Risk:** [Describe the most significant risk for the *entire feature*, e.g., "Security of the end-to-end reset process."]
*   **Mitigation:** [Describe the high-level strategy to mitigate this risk, e.g., "Implement short-lived, single-use, cryptographically secure tokens. Enforce password complexity rules on the server-side."]
*   **Secondary Risk:** [e.g., Impact on existing authentication performance.]
*   **Mitigation:** [e.g., "Ensure new database queries are optimized and indexed to avoid locking user tables during login."]

**5. Recommended Implementation Order (Dependency Chain):**
1.  `[First_NodeID_To_Build]` (Reason: Foundational, no internal dependencies)
2.  `[Second_NodeID_To_Build]` (Reason: Depends on #1)
3.  `[Third_NodeID_To_Build]` (Reason: Depends on #2)
4.  *(... and so on)*

**6. Recommendation & Next Steps:**
This analysis provides a comprehensive plan for achieving the `PrimaryGoal`. The project is ready for implementation to begin.

**Next Command:** To start development, use **`Noderr v1.9: Start Work Session`** and provide the exact `PrimaryGoal` from this analysis. The agent will then use this report as the primary input for proposing the formal Change Set in `[LOOP_1A]`.
