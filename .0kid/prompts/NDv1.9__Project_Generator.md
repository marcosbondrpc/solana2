*   **Testing Framework(s) & Version(s):** [Agent: Refer to Technology Stack, e.g., "Jest 29.x for unit/integration (JavaScript)", "PyTest 7.x for Python".]
*   **Test File Location & Naming:** [Agent: e.g., "Test files located adjacent to source files (`module.test.js`) or in a dedicated `__tests__`/`tests/` directory. Test names should be descriptive: `it('should return sum of two numbers')`."]
*   **Minimum Code Coverage Target (Conceptual Goal):** [Agent: e.g., "Aim for >70% for unit-tested core logic." State as an aim, not a strict CI blocker for MVP unless specified by user.]

---

### 11. Initial Setup Steps (Conceptual for a new developer/environment)

1.  **Clone Repository:** `git clone [repository_url]`
2.  **Install Language/Tools:** (Agent: Check versions against Tech Stack; use `noderr/EnvironmentContext.md` for specific commands).
3.  **Install Dependencies:** (Agent: Use the dependency manager defined in `noderr/EnvironmentContext.md`, e.g., `npm install`).
4.  **Environment Variables & Secrets:**
    *   [Agent: List any anticipated required environment variables based on common app needs or `UserProjectIdea`, e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `ANY_EXTERNAL_API_KEY`].
    *   (Agent: Secrets must be stored securely, e.g., in a `.env` file loaded at runtime, and never committed to version control).
5.  **Database Setup (If applicable):**
    *   [Agent: e.g., "Run database migrations using the command specified in `noderr/EnvironmentContext.md`, such as `npx prisma migrate dev`."]
6.  **Run Development Server:**
    *   [Agent: Specify the typical run command for the chosen stack, e.g., `npm run dev`, `python main.py`.]
    *   (Agent: The server must bind to the host and port specified in `noderr/EnvironmentContext.md`).

### 12. Key Architectural Decisions & Rationale

*   **Decision 1: [Agent: e.g., Choice of Primary Language/Framework - e.g., Node.js with Express.js]**
    *   **Rationale:** [Agent: e.g., "Chosen for its non-blocking I/O suitable for web applications and its large ecosystem of packages." If user specified, use their rationale or infer and confirm.]
*   **Decision 2: [Agent: e.g., Database Choice - e.g., PostgreSQL]**
    *   **Rationale:** [Agent: e.g., "Selected for its robustness, SQL capabilities, and wide support from ORMs and cloud providers."]
*   **(Optional) Decision 3: [Agent: e.g., Architectural Style - e.g., Monolithic App for MVP]**
    *   **Rationale:** [Agent: e.g., "A monolithic approach was chosen for the MVP to simplify initial development and deployment, reducing complexity. Microservices can be considered for future scaling if needed."]

### 13. Repository Link

*   `[Agent: Link to Git Repository. User/Orchestrator will confirm/update.]` (Can be placeholder initially: "[To be confirmed/updated]")

---

### 14. Dependencies & Third-Party Services (Key Ones for MVP)

*   **[Service 1 Name - Agent: e.g., PostgreSQL Database]:**
    *   Purpose: Primary data storage.
    *   Integration: Via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
*   **(Optional) [External API Name - Agent: e.g., Stripe API]:**
    *   Purpose: [Agent: e.g., "To handle payments."]
    *   Integration: [Agent: e.g., "Via HTTP POST requests to their API endpoint. Requires API key."]
    *   Required Credentials: `[Agent: e.g., STRIPE_API_KEY]` (To be stored as an environment variable).
*   *(Agent: List only essential external services for the MVP based on `UserProjectIdea`.)*

---

### 15. Security Considerations (Initial High-Level)

*   **Authentication:** [Agent: e.g., "Session-based authentication using secure, HTTP-only cookies and a `SESSION_SECRET` stored as an environment variable / JWT-based authentication for APIs." Passwords **MUST** be hashed (e.g., using bcrypt or argon2).]
*   **Authorization:** [Agent: e.g., "Basic role-based access control if multiple user types exist. Check authorization on the server-side for all sensitive operations."]
*   **Input Validation:** [Agent: e.g., "All user inputs (forms, API request bodies/params) MUST be validated on the server-side to prevent common injection attacks (XSS, SQLi - though ORM mitigates SQLi largely)."]
*   **Data Protection:**
    *   "Sensitive data (e.g., PII, passwords) handled with care. Avoid logging sensitive data."
    *   "Use HTTPS in production environments."
*   **Dependency Management:** [Agent: e.g., "Dependencies will be kept updated. Use `npm audit` / `pip-audit` or similar tools periodically."]
*   **Secrets Management:** "All API keys, database credentials, and other secrets **MUST** be stored as environment variables and not hardcoded."

---

### 16. Performance Requirements (Initial Qualitative Goals)

*   **Response Time:** [Agent: e.g., "Web pages and API responses should generally feel responsive, aiming for <500ms for common operations under typical load." Suggest sensible defaults.]
*   **Load Capacity (Conceptual for MVP):** [Agent: e.g., "Application should handle a small number of concurrent users smoothly (e.g., 10-50)."]
*   **Scalability Approach (Future Consideration):** [Agent: e.g., "For MVP, vertical scaling is the primary approach. Horizontal scaling or more complex strategies are future considerations."]

---

### 17. Monitoring & Observability (Basic for MVP)

*   **Logging Strategy (Application-level):**
    *   [Agent: e.g., "Structured JSON logging to console for key application events, errors, and requests (e.g., using a library like Pino for Node.js or standard Python logging module)."]
    *   "Include timestamps, log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR), and relevant context (e.g., request ID)."
*   **Monitoring Tools:** [Agent: e.g., "For MVP, rely on standard console/file logs. No complex external tools unless user specifies."]
*   **Key Metrics to Observe (Qualitative):** Error rates in logs, general application responsiveness.
*   **Alerting Criteria (Manual for MVP):** [Agent: e.g., "Monitor logs for frequent errors or performance degradation manually."]
