# Noderr v1.9: Advanced Security Audit

## Your Mission
You are to perform a comprehensive, context-aware security audit of the entire application. Go beyond simple dependency scanning. Your mission is to analyze the application's architecture, data flows, and business logic to identify potential vulnerabilities based on the **OWASP Top 10** standard. The output will be a prioritized, actionable report that integrates with the Noderr workflow.

### Phase 1: Automated Foundation Scan
*Using the appropriate tools defined in your `environment_context.md`, perform the following automated scans:*
1.  **Dependency Vulnerability Scan:** Run the standard security audit tool for your language (e.g., `npm audit`, `pip-audit`).
2.  **Static Analysis (SAST):** If a SAST tool is configured, run it to find common security anti-patterns in the source code.
3.  **Secrets Scan:** Scan the repository for any hardcoded secrets or keys that may have been accidentally committed.

### Phase 2: Manual (Logical) Threat Modeling & Analysis
*This is the core of the audit. Systematically review the codebase for vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10. For each category, analyze the relevant `NodeID`s.*

#### A1: Broken Access Control
*   **What to look for:** Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs), Privilege Escalation.
*   **Action:** Review API endpoints that accept IDs (e.g., `/api/orders/:id`). Is there a check to ensure the logged-in user *owns* that order? Review admin-only routes. Is the authorization check robust and applied consistently?

#### A2: Cryptographic Failures
*   **What to look for:** Sensitive data exposure (in transit and at rest), use of weak/outdated algorithms.
*   **Action:** Check how passwords, API keys, and PII are stored in the database (`DB_` nodes). Are they hashed with modern algorithms (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt)? Is TLS enforced?

#### A3: Injection
*   **What to look for:** SQL injection, NoSQL injection, Command injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Action:** Review all code where user input is used to construct database queries, system commands, or HTML output. Does the ORM prevent SQLi effectively? Is all data rendered in the UI properly escaped or sanitized?

#### A4: Insecure Design
*   **What to look for:** Flaws in business logic that can be abused.
*   **Action:** Review flows like password reset, coupon application, etc. Can the password reset token be enumerated? Can a coupon code be applied multiple times?

#### A5: Security Misconfiguration
*   **What to look for:** Default credentials, verbose error messages that leak information, unnecessary features enabled, missing security headers.
*   **Action:** Check configuration files and server setup logic. Are there any default passwords? Do error responses in production reveal stack traces?

#### A6-A10: Other Categories
*   **Action:** Briefly review for other common issues:
    *   **Vulnerable Components:** (Correlate with Phase 1 scan) How are the vulnerable dependencies being used?
    *   **Identification & Authentication Failures:** Brute-force protection, session management security.
    *   **Software & Data Integrity Failures:** Are dependencies being downloaded from trusted sources?
    *   **Security Logging & Monitoring Failures:** Are security-sensitive events (e.g., failed logins, access denials) being logged?
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** If the application fetches resources from user-supplied URLs, are those URLs validated?

### Phase 3: Reporting & Action Plan
*Synthesize all findings into a single, comprehensive report.*

#### Security Audit Report - [Generated Timestamp]

**1. Executive Summary:**
*   **Overall Risk Level:** [Critical / High / Medium / Low]
*   **Key Finding:** [A one-sentence summary of the most critical vulnerability found.]
*   **Summary:** Found [X] critical, [Y] high, and [Z] medium-severity vulnerabilities.

**2. Vulnerability Findings (Prioritized by Severity):**

| Severity | Affected Node(s) | Vulnerability Class (OWASP) | Description & Specific Remediation Advice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Critical** | `API_User` | A1: Broken Access Control | The `/api/users/:id` endpoint does not verify ownership, allowing any authenticated user to view any other user's profile data by guessing the ID. **Remediation:** Add a middleware check to ensure `req.user.id === req.params.id`. |
| **High** | `Config` | A5: Security Misconfiguration | The JWT secret is hardcoded in `config.js` instead of being loaded from an environment variable. **Remediation:** Move the JWT secret to a required environment variable. |
| **Medium** | `Dependencies` | A6: Vulnerable Components | The `axios` library is outdated and has a moderate-severity ReDoS vulnerability. The vulnerable function is not currently used, but the library should be updated. **Remediation:** Update `axios` to the latest version. |

**3. Action Plan:**
*   **Critical Issues (Address Immediately):**
    *   For `API_User`: The vulnerability requires a code change. **Next Command:** Use `NDv1.9__Handle_Critical_Issue.txt` to triage and fix this bug.
*   **High-Severity Issues (Address This Cycle):**
    *   For `Config`: This is a small, localized fix. **Next Command:** Use `NDv1.9__Execute_Micro_Fix.txt` to move the secret.
*   **Medium/Low-Severity & Technical Debt:**
    *   For `Dependencies`: This is a dependency update. **Next Command:** Schedule this work by creating a `REFACTOR_Dependencies` task in `noderr_tracker.md`.

*Present this complete report to the Orchestrator for review and authorization before taking any corrective action.*
