# NDv1.9__Post_Installation_Audit.md

## Purpose
Comprehensive post-installation audit to verify the enhanced Install & Reconcile process delivered on all promises. This audit validates system integrity, confirms 100% completeness, verifies proper environment distinction, and certifies development readiness for complete MVP roadmap.

---

## Instructions for AI Agent

You are conducting a critical verification audit after the `NDv1.9__Install_And_Reconcile.md` process. Your role is to **verify Install kept its promises**, not to redo its work.

**Install Promised:**
- ✅ 100% complete environment context (0 [brackets] remaining)
- ✅ **Clear distinction between development and production environments**
- ✅ Every existing component found and documented as NodeID
- ✅ **MVP gap analysis completed** - all missing components for MVP identified
- ✅ **Complete system specifications** (existing + missing components)
- ✅ **Complete architectural documentation** of existing system + MVP requirements
- ✅ **Architecture follows Generator conventions** - proper NodeIDs, Legend, shapes
- ✅ All commands tested and working **in the development environment**
- ✅ **Complete MVP development roadmap** created

**Your Job:** Verify these promises were kept, identify any gaps, and automatically fill missing components to ensure 100% coverage.

### Prerequisites
- Installation and reconciliation must be marked as complete
- All core Noderr files must exist
- Codebase must be accessible for verification

---

## PHASE 1: VERIFY INSTALL COMPLETENESS

### 1.1 Critical Promise Verification

**PROMISE 1: Environment Context 100% Complete**
```bash
# Count remaining [bracketed placeholders]
bracket_count=$(grep -c "\[.*\]" noderr/environment_context.md)
echo "Brackets remaining: $bracket_count"

# REQUIREMENT: Must be 0
if [ $bracket_count -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Environment context 100% complete"
else
    echo "❌ FAIL: $bracket_count placeholders still remain"
fi
```

**PROMISE 2: Development vs Production Distinction**
```bash
# Check that both URLs are documented
if grep -q "local_dev_preview" noderr/environment_context.md && grep -q "public_deployed_app" noderr/environment_context.md; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Both development and production URLs documented"
    
    # Extract and display the URLs
    dev_url=$(grep -A 2 'local_dev_preview:' noderr/environment_context.md | grep 'url:' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)
    prod_url=$(grep -A 2 'public_deployed_app:' noderr/environment_context.md | grep 'url:' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)
    
    echo "Development URL: $dev_url"
    echo "Production URL: $prod_url"
    
    # Verify clear usage instructions
    if grep -q "DO NOT.*test\|Primary development testing URL" noderr/environment_context.md; then
        echo "✅ PASS: Clear instructions on which URL to use for testing"
    else
        echo "⚠️ WARN: Missing clear instructions on URL usage"
    fi
else
    echo "❌ FAIL: Environment distinction missing"
fi
```

**PROMISE 3: Complete System Specs = NodeIDs Count (Existing + Missing)**
```bash
# Count NodeIDs in architecture (should include existing + missing for MVP)
nodeid_count=$(grep -o "[A-Z][A-Z_]*[A-Z]" noderr/noderr_architecture.md | sort -u | wc -l)

# Count spec files
spec_count=$(ls noderr/specs/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

echo "NodeIDs in architecture (existing + missing): $nodeid_count"
echo "Spec files created: $spec_count"

# REQUIREMENT: Must match exactly
if [ $nodeid_count -eq $spec_count ]; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Every NodeID has a spec ($nodeid_count = $spec_count)"
else
    echo "❌ FAIL: Mismatch - $nodeid_count NodeIDs but $spec_count specs"
fi
```

**PROMISE 4: MVP Gap Analysis Completed**
```bash
# Check for MVP analysis documentation in project file
if grep -q "MVP Implementation Status\|MVP Completion" noderr/noderr_project.md; then
    echo "✅ PASS: MVP analysis found in project file"
else
    echo "❌ FAIL: No MVP completion analysis found"
fi

# Check for missing components marked as "Required for MVP" in tracker
mvp_missing_count=$(grep -c "Required for MVP\|PLANNED.*MVP" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
echo "Missing MVP components identified: $mvp_missing_count"
```

**PROMISE 5: All Core Files Populated**
- [ ] `noderr/noderr_project.md` - No [placeholders], real tech stack versions, **MVP analysis included**
- [ ] `noderr/noderr_architecture.md` - Valid Mermaid diagram with **all NodeIDs (existing + missing)**
- [ ] `noderr/noderr_tracker.md` - **All NodeIDs listed** (existing + missing for MVP) with realistic statuses
- [ ] `noderr/noderr_log.md` - SystemInitialization entry with **complete system summary** and **environment distinction**
- [ ] `environment_context.md` - 100% complete with tested commands **and clear dev/prod distinction**

### 1.2 Environment Commands Verification

**Test Critical Commands Actually Work:**
```bash
# Test package installation command from environment_context.md
[Extract and test the documented package install command]

# Test development server command
[Extract and test the documented dev server command]

# Test that development URL works
dev_url=$(grep -A 2 'local_dev_preview:' noderr/environment_context.md | grep 'url:' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)
echo "Testing development URL: $dev_url"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Dev server status: %{http_code}\n" "$dev_url"

# Verify we're NOT testing production
prod_url=$(grep -A 2 'public_deployed_app:' noderr/environment_context.md | grep 'url:' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)
echo "Production URL (NOT testing): $prod_url"

# Test git operations
git status
git log --oneline -3

# Test build command (if applicable)
[Extract and test the documented build command]
```

**Document Results:**
- ✅ All commands work as documented
- ✅ Development URL accessible for testing
- ✅ Clear which URL to use for development
- ⚠️ Some commands need adjustment 
- ❌ Commands fail - environment context incomplete

### 1.3 Complete System Architecture Integrity Check

**Verify Architecture Generator Conventions:**
```bash
echo "=== ARCHITECTURE GENERATOR CONVENTIONS CHECK ===" > architecture_verify_log.txt

# Check for Legend presence (MANDATORY per Architecture Generator)
if grep -q "subgraph Legend" noderr/noderr_architecture.md; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Legend subgraph found" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
else
    echo "❌ FAIL: Missing required Legend subgraph" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
    echo "Architecture Generator REQUIRES a Legend section" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
fi

# Check NodeID format compliance
# Extract all potential NodeIDs and verify they follow TYPE_Name pattern
echo "=== NodeID Convention Check ===" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
nodeids=$(grep -oE '\b[A-Z][A-Z_]*[A-Za-z]+\b' noderr/noderr_architecture.md | grep -v "^L_" | sort -u)
invalid_count=0
for nodeid in $nodeids; do
    if ! echo "$nodeid" | grep -qE "^[A-Z]+_[A-Za-z]+"; then
        echo "❌ Invalid NodeID format: $nodeid" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
        ((invalid_count++))
    fi
done

if [ $invalid_count -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ PASS: All NodeIDs follow TYPE_Name convention" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
else
    echo "❌ FAIL: $invalid_count NodeIDs don't follow convention" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
fi

# Check for consistent component shapes
echo "=== Component Shape Consistency Check ===" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
# Check if UI components use [/...\] format
ui_count=$(grep -c "UI_[A-Za-z]*\[/" noderr/noderr_architecture.md)
ui_wrong=$(grep -c "UI_[A-Za-z]*\[^/" noderr/noderr_architecture.md)
if [ $ui_wrong -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ PASS: UI components use consistent [/...\] shape" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
else
    echo "⚠️ WARN: Some UI components don't use [/...\] shape" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
fi

# Check Legend content matches actual usage
if grep -q "L_UI\[/.*\]" noderr/noderr_architecture.md; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Legend defines UI component shape" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
else
    echo "⚠️ WARN: Legend missing UI component shape definition" >> architecture_verify_log.txt
fi
```

**Verify Architecture Diagram Structure:**
- [ ] **Legend Present** - Contains valid Legend subgraph with shape definitions
- [ ] **NodeID Convention** - All components follow TYPE_Name pattern (e.g., UI_HomePage, API_GetUser)
- [ ] **NOT using plain labels** - No components like "Home Page" or "GET /user/profile"
- [ ] Contains valid Mermaid syntax that renders properly
- [ ] Shows logical component groupings using subgraphs
- [ ] NodeID naming follows conventions (TYPE_Name format) consistently
- [ ] Connections represent actual code dependencies
- [ ] **Includes existing components AND missing components for MVP**
- [ ] **Missing components clearly marked** (comments, styling, or subgraphs)
- [ ] No orphaned or disconnected components
- [ ] All major existing components are represented

**Verify Component Categories (Existing + Missing):**
- [ ] **UI Components**: All use UI_ prefix and [/...\] shape
- [ ] **API Endpoints**: All use API_ prefix
- [ ] **Services**: All use SVC_ prefix
- [ ] **Data Components**: All use appropriate prefixes (MODEL_, DATA_, etc.)
- [ ] **Utilities**: All use UTIL_ or CONFIG_ prefixes
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: All use appropriate prefixes

### 1.4 MVP Completeness Verification

**Analyze MVP Feature Coverage:**
```bash
# Extract MVP features from project file
echo "=== MVP COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION ===" > mvp_analysis_log.txt

# Check if Install properly analyzed each MVP feature
if grep -q "Key Features (In Scope for MVP)" noderr/noderr_project.md; then
    echo "✅ MVP features section found" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt
    
    # For each MVP feature, verify analysis was done
    mvp_features=$(grep -A 10 "Key Features (In Scope for MVP)" noderr/noderr_project.md | grep -E "^\s*\*.*:" | wc -l)
    echo "MVP features identified: $mvp_features" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt
    
    # Check if implementation status was documented
    if grep -q "MVP Implementation Status\|MVP Completion" noderr/noderr_project.md; then
        echo "✅ MVP implementation status documented" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt
    else
        echo "❌ MISSING: MVP implementation analysis not found" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt
    fi
else
    echo "❌ CRITICAL: MVP features section missing" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt
fi
```

**Verify Missing Component Identification:**
```bash
# Count components marked as missing/planned for MVP
planned_components=$(grep -c "PLANNED.*MVP\|Required for MVP\|Missing.*MVP" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
echo "Components identified as missing for MVP: $planned_components" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt

# Verify missing components have specs with PLANNED status
planned_specs=$(grep -l "PLANNED.*MVP\|Required for MVP" specs/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
echo "Specs created for missing MVP components: $planned_specs" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt

if [ $planned_components -eq $planned_specs ]; then
    echo "✅ All missing MVP components have specifications" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt
else
    echo "❌ Mismatch: $planned_components missing components but $planned_specs specs" >> mvp_analysis_log.txt
fi
```

### 1.5 Tracker-Architecture-Specs Alignment (Complete System)

**Verify Complete System Tracker Consistency:**
- [ ] Every NodeID from architecture is in tracker (existing + missing)
- [ ] Every spec file has corresponding tracker entry
- [ ] All spec links in tracker point to existing files
- [ ] Dependencies listed make architectural sense
- [ ] **Missing components properly marked** with "Required for MVP" or similar
- [ ] **MVP completion percentage calculated** correctly

**Verify Specification Quality (Sample Check - Both Types):**
- Sample 3 **existing** NodeIDs from different categories
- Sample 2 **missing/planned** NodeIDs for MVP
- For each sampled spec:
  - [ ] Contains clear Purpose statement
  - [ ] Implementation status correctly reflects **IMPLEMENTED** or **PLANNED**
  - [ ] ARC verification criteria are comprehensive
  - [ ] Technical debt is honestly documented (for existing)
  - [ ] **MVP context documented** (for missing components)
  - [ ] No [placeholder] text remains
  - [ ] Implementation details match actual code location (for existing)

### 1.6 Codebase-Architecture Alignment

**Deep-Dive Verification:**
- Sample 3 **existing** NodeIDs from architecture diagram
- Verify they actually exist in codebase at documented locations
- Check that architecture connections reflect actual code dependencies
- Confirm no major codebase areas are unrepresented in architecture

**Component Completeness Check:**
- Scan codebase for any major components not in architecture
- Verify Install didn't miss any significant existing functionality
- Document any major gaps between codebase reality and documentation

### 1.7 Environment Distinction Verification

**Verify Proper Environment Documentation:**
```bash
echo "=== ENVIRONMENT DISTINCTION VERIFICATION ===" > env_verify_log.txt

# Check environment focus is documented
if grep -q "environment_focus.*DEVELOPMENT\|Environment Type.*DEVELOPMENT" noderr/environment_context.md; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Environment clearly marked as DEVELOPMENT" >> env_verify_log.txt
else
    echo "❌ FAIL: Environment type not clearly marked" >> env_verify_log.txt
fi

# Check for proper URL documentation
dev_url=$(grep -A 2 'local_dev_preview:' noderr/environment_context.md | grep 'url:' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)
prod_url=$(grep -A 2 'public_deployed_app:' noderr/environment_context.md | grep 'url:' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)

if [ -n "$dev_url" ] && [ -n "$prod_url" ]; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Both URLs properly extracted" >> env_verify_log.txt
    echo "Development URL: $dev_url" >> env_verify_log.txt
    echo "Production URL: $prod_url" >> env_verify_log.txt
else
    echo "❌ FAIL: Could not extract both URLs" >> env_verify_log.txt
fi

# Check for usage warnings
if grep -q "DO NOT.*test.*production\|DO NOT USE FOR TESTING" noderr/environment_context.md; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Production URL has proper warnings" >> env_verify_log.txt
else
    echo "⚠️ WARN: Missing clear warnings about production URL usage" >> env_verify_log.txt
fi

# Check log entry mentions environment
if grep -q "Development URL\|local_dev_preview\|Environment Focus" noderr/noderr_log.md; then
    echo "✅ PASS: Log entry documents environment distinction" >> env_verify_log.txt
else
    echo "⚠️ WARN: Log entry doesn't mention environment distinction" >> env_verify_log.txt
fi
```

## PHASE 2: GAP ANALYSIS & AUTO-COMPLETION

### 2.1 Comprehensive Component Gap Analysis

**Even with thorough Install process, verify no existing components were missed:**

#### Scan for Missing Frontend Components
```bash
# Look for React/Vue/Angular components not in architecture
find . -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.vue" -o -name "*.svelte" | grep -v node_modules | while read file; do
    component_name=$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.[^.]*$//')
    if ! grep -q "UI_$component_name\|$component_name" noderr/noderr_architecture.md; then
        echo "MISSING UI COMPONENT: $file -> UI_$component_name"
    fi
done
```

#### Scan for Missing Backend Components  
```bash
# Look for API routes/endpoints not in architecture
find . -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" | grep -v node_modules | xargs grep -l "app\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\)\|@app\.route\|router\." | while read file; do
    echo "Checking API routes in: $file"
    # Extract route definitions and check if documented
done
```

#### Scan for Missing Data Components
```bash
# Look for models, schemas, database-related files
find . -name "*model*" -o -name "*schema*" -o -name "*migration*" | grep -v node_modules | while read file; do
    component_name=$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.[^.]*$//')
    if ! grep -q "MODEL_\|DATA_\|MIGRATION_" noderr/noderr_architecture.md; then
        echo "MISSING DATA COMPONENT: $file"
    fi
done
```

#### Scan for Missing Utility Components
```bash
# Look for utility functions, helpers, config files
find . -name "*util*" -o -name "*helper*" -o -name "*config*" -o -name "constants*" | grep -v node_modules | while read file; do
    component_name=$(basename "$file" | sed 's/\.[^.]*$//')
    if ! grep -q "UTIL_\|CONFIG_\|CONST_" noderr/noderr_architecture.md; then
        echo "MISSING UTILITY COMPONENT: $file"
    fi
done
```

### 2.2 MANDATORY: Create Missing NodeIDs and Specs

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Every discovered gap MUST be automatically filled.

#### Step 1: Generate Missing NodeID List
```bash
echo "=== GAP ANALYSIS RESULTS ===" > gap_analysis_log.txt
echo "Scanning for components missed by Install process..." >> gap_analysis_log.txt

# Collect all missing components from above scans
missing_components=()
# [Process each scan result and add to missing_components array]

total_missing=$(echo "${missing_components[@]}" | wc -w)
echo "TOTAL MISSING COMPONENTS: $total_missing" >> gap_analysis_log.txt

if [ $total_missing -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ NO GAPS FOUND: Install process was complete" >> gap_analysis_log.txt
else
    echo "⚠️ GAPS FOUND: $total_missing components missed by Install" >> gap_analysis_log.txt
fi
```

#### Step 2: Auto-Create Specs for Missing Components

**For each missing component found:**

```bash
# For each missing component, create NodeID and spec
for missing_component in "${missing_components[@]}"; do
    # Determine appropriate NodeID based on component type
    nodeid=$(determine_nodeid_from_file "$missing_component")
    
    echo "Creating missing spec: $nodeid" >> gap_analysis_log.txt
    
    # Create spec file
    cat > specs/${nodeid}.md << 'EOF'
# [NodeID].md

EOF

    # Replace [NodeID] with actual NodeID
    sed -i "s/\[NodeID\]/$nodeid/g" specs/${nodeid}.md
    
    echo "✅ Created missing spec: specs/${nodeid}.md" >> gap_analysis_log.txt
done
```

#### Step 3: Update Architecture & Tracker

**Add missing NodeIDs to architecture diagram:**
```bash
echo "=== UPDATING ARCHITECTURE ===" >> gap_analysis_log.txt

# For each missing NodeID, add to appropriate section of architecture
for nodeid in "${missing_nodeids[@]}"; do
    echo "Adding $nodeid to architecture diagram..." >> gap_analysis_log.txt
    # Add to noderr/noderr_architecture.md in appropriate subgraph
    
    echo "Adding $nodeid to tracker..." >> gap_analysis_log.txt  
    # Add to noderr/noderr_tracker.md with appropriate status
done

echo "✅ Architecture and tracker updates complete" >> gap_analysis_log.txt
```

#### Step 4: Re-Verify Complete Coverage

**MANDATORY Mathematical Verification After Gap Filling:**
```bash
echo "=== FINAL COVERAGE VERIFICATION ===" >> gap_analysis_log.txt

# Count NodeIDs in updated architecture
final_nodeid_count=$(grep -o "[A-Z][A-Z_]*[A-Z]" noderr/noderr_architecture.md | sort -u | wc -l)

# Count total specs (original + newly created)
final_spec_count=$(ls specs/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

echo "Final NodeIDs in architecture: $final_nodeid_count" >> gap_analysis_log.txt
echo "Final specs created: $final_spec_count" >> gap_analysis_log.txt

if [ $final_nodeid_count -eq $final_spec_count ]; then
    echo "✅ SUCCESS: Complete coverage achieved after gap filling" >> gap_analysis_log.txt
    echo "System now has 100% component coverage"
else
    echo "❌ FAILURE: Still missing $((final_nodeid_count - final_spec_count)) specs" >> gap_analysis_log.txt
    echo "CRITICAL: Gap filling incomplete"
    exit 1
fi
```

### 2.3 Document Gap Analysis Results

```markdown
## Post-Install Gap Analysis Results
### Components Missed by Install Process:
- **Total Missed**: [X] components discovered in gap analysis
- **Categories**: 
  - UI Components: [A] missed → [A] added
  - API Endpoints: [B] missed → [B] added
  - Data Components: [C] missed → [C] added
  - Utilities: [D] missed → [D] added

### Gap Filling Actions Taken:
- **NodeIDs Created**: [X] new NodeIDs for missed components
- **Specs Created**: [X] new specifications written
- **Architecture Updated**: All new NodeIDs added to diagram
- **Tracker Updated**: All new NodeIDs added with appropriate status

### Final Coverage Statistics:
- **Original Coverage**: [Y] NodeIDs from Install (existing + planned)
- **Discovered Gaps**: [X] missed existing components  
- **Final Coverage**: [Y+X] NodeIDs (100% complete)
- **Coverage Increase**: [X]% more components now documented
```

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT: Cannot proceed to Phase 3 until gap analysis reports 100% coverage AND Architecture Generator conventions verified AND environment distinction confirmed.**

## PHASE 3: MVP ROADMAP & SYSTEM HEALTH ASSESSMENT

### 3.1 MVP Completion Analysis

**Verify MVP Analysis Quality:**
```bash
# Analyze MVP completion status from tracker
existing_count=$(grep -c "✅.*IMPLEMENTED\|🟢.*VERIFIED" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
planned_count=$(grep -c "⚪.*PLANNED\|Required for MVP" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
todo_existing=$(grep -c "⚪.*TODO" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
issue_count=$(grep -c "❗.*ISSUE" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)

total_for_mvp=$((existing_count + planned_count))
mvp_completion=$((existing_count * 100 / total_for_mvp))

echo "MVP Completion Analysis:"
echo "✅ EXISTING (Implemented): $existing_count components"
echo "⚪ MISSING (Planned for MVP): $planned_count components"
echo "🔧 TODO (Existing needs work): $todo_existing components" 
echo "❗ ISSUES (Broken existing): $issue_count components"
echo "📊 MVP COMPLETION: $mvp_completion% ($existing_count/$total_for_mvp)"
```

**Verify MVP Feature Analysis:**
- [ ] Each MVP feature from project file has implementation status
- [ ] Missing components properly mapped to MVP features
- [ ] Dependencies between existing and missing components documented
- [ ] MVP completion percentage is realistic and calculated correctly

### 3.2 System Health Assessment

**Implementation Status Analysis:**
```bash
# Count component statuses from tracker (existing + missing)
verified_count=$(grep -c "🟢 \[VERIFIED\]" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
todo_count=$(grep -c "⚪ \[TODO\]" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
planned_count=$(grep -c "⚪.*PLANNED" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
issue_count=$(grep -c "❗ \[ISSUE\]" noderr/noderr_tracker.md)
total_count=$((verified_count + todo_count + planned_count + issue_count))

echo "Complete System Health Analysis:"
echo "✅ VERIFIED: $verified_count ($((verified_count * 100 / total_count))%)"
echo "⚪ TODO (existing): $todo_count ($((todo_count * 100 / total_count))%)"
echo "⚪ PLANNED (missing): $planned_count ($((planned_count * 100 / total_count))%)"
echo "❗ ISSUES: $issue_count ($((issue_count * 100 / total_count))%)"
echo "📊 TOTAL SYSTEM: $total_count components"
```

**Code Quality Assessment:**
- Review specs for honest technical debt documentation
- Check if statuses reflect actual code quality vs planned quality
- Verify improvement opportunities are properly categorized
- Assess if missing component specifications are realistic

### 3.3 Development Environment Readiness

**Verify Development Environment is Properly Configured:**
```bash
echo "=== DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT READINESS ===" > dev_ready_log.txt

# Extract URLs
dev_url=$(grep -A 2 'local_dev_preview:' noderr/environment_context.md | grep 'url:' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)
prod_url=$(grep -A 2 'public_deployed_app:' noderr/environment_context.md | grep 'url:' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f2)

# Test development URL accessibility
if curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "$dev_url" | grep -q "200\|201\|301\|302"; then
    echo "✅ Development URL accessible: $dev_url" >> dev_ready_log.txt
else
    echo "⚠️ Development URL not responding as expected: $dev_url" >> dev_ready_log.txt
fi

# Verify development commands work
if grep -q "npm run dev\|yarn dev\|python.*runserver" noderr/environment_context.md; then
    echo "✅ Development server command documented" >> dev_ready_log.txt
else
    echo "⚠️ No clear development server command found" >> dev_ready_log.txt
fi

# Check for clear testing instructions
if grep -q "Primary development testing URL\|Use.*for.*testing" noderr/environment_context.md; then
    echo "✅ Clear testing instructions present" >> dev_ready_log.txt
else
    echo "❌ Missing clear testing instructions" >> dev_ready_log.txt
fi
```
