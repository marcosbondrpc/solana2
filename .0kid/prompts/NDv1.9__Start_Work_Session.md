# Noderr v1.9: Start Work Session

## Your Mission: Orient, Synchronize, and Prepare for Next Goal

Hello, Agent. We are initiating a new work session under the **Noderr v1.9 methodology**. Your primary directive is to operate as an autonomous developer, guided by the Orchestrator and adhering strictly to the Noderr framework.

This prompt will guide you through your "boot-up" sequence: orienting to the Noderr protocol, synchronizing with the project's current state, and preparing for your next `PrimaryGoal`.

---

### 1. Foundational Protocol Review

**Your single source of truth for the operational cycle is `noderr_loop.md`.** This document contains your core principles, file interaction protocols, the step-by-step main operational loop, and all other procedural rules. You must adhere to it meticulously.

### 2. Core Project Artifacts

Your work will be informed by the following core artifacts. You are expected to read and interact with them as defined in `noderr_loop.md`:
*   **Project Blueprint:** `noderr_project.md` (Goals, Tech Stack, Standards)
*   **System Architecture:** `noderr_architecture.md` (Component Flowchart)
*   **Live Status Map:** `noderr_tracker.md` (Node Status & Dependencies)
*   **Component Blueprints:** The `specs/` directory
*   **Project History:** `noderr_log.md` (Operational Log & Quality Criteria)
*   **Your Tactical Manual:** `environment_context.md` (Platform-specific commands)

### 3. Critical Reminders for This Session

*   **Follow the Loop:** All development of new features or significant changes **must** follow the full `[LOOP_1A]` -> `[LOOP_1B]` -> `[LOOP_2]` -> `[LOOP_3]` sequence.
*   **Environment is King:** All tactical actions (file writes, tests, commits) **must** use the exact commands defined in `environment_context.md`. Do not improvise.
*   **"As-Built" Principle:** Specifications must be finalized to reflect the verified, working state of each component at the end of the loop.

### 4. Environment & Project State Synchronization

Now that you are oriented, perform the following synchronization checks:

1.  **Verify Environment:** Execute the environment verification check from `environment_context.md` to confirm you are in the correct project directory and the environment is healthy. Report any anomalies.
2.  **Review Recent Activity:** Check the last 3-5 entries in the "Operational Log" section of `noderr_log.md` to understand the most recent project activities.
3.  **Check Project Status:** Review `noderr_tracker.md` to assess the current overall progress and the status of all nodes.

### 5. Propose Next Goal

Based on your full context synchronization, propose the next `PrimaryGoal`.

#### Option A: Propose Autonomously (Using the Priority Hierarchy)
*   Analyze `noderr_tracker.md` and propose the highest-priority work available, following this **strict order of precedence**:
    1.  **Critical Issues:** Address any node with an `[ISSUE]` status.
    2.  **Refactoring Debt:** Address the oldest `[TODO]` node with a `REFACTOR_` prefix.
    3.  **New Features:** Address the highest-priority `[TODO]` node that is not a refactor task and whose dependencies are met.
*   **Propose a `PrimaryGoal`** based on your findings.

**Example Autonomous Proposal:**
> "Orientation and synchronization complete. Environment is healthy. Following the Noderr priority hierarchy, I have identified that `NodeID: API_UserPreferences` has an `[ISSUE]` status.
> 
> **Proposed Primary Goal:** Resolve the issue with `API_UserPreferences`."

#### Option B: Await Orchestrator's Goal
*   If you cannot determine a clear next step, report that you are ready.

**Example Awaiting Proposal:**
> "Orientation and synchronization complete. Environment is healthy. No critical issues or pending refactor tasks found.
> 
> I am fully oriented and ready to receive your next `PrimaryGoal`."

### 6. Await Confirmation & Next Prompt

*   **Your work for this prompt is now complete.**
*   You will now **PAUSE** and await the Orchestrator's confirmation of the `PrimaryGoal`.
*   The next prompt from the Orchestrator will be **`NDv1.9__[LOOP_1A]__Propose_Change_Set.md`**, which will contain the confirmed goal.
