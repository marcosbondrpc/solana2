# Universal Environment Context Profile Template

<!-- 
🚨 CRITICAL ENVIRONMENT AWARENESS CHECK 🚨

Before proceeding, answer these questions:
1. Are you in a development environment? (Replit workspace, Codespaces, local machine, etc.)
2. What do you see in your current shell prompt?
3. Is there a separate deployed/production version of this app?

YOUR MISSION: Document the DEVELOPMENT environment you're currently in.
You are NOT documenting the production/deployed environment.

Remember:
- Development = Where you write and test code
- Production = Where real users access the app
- NEVER confuse these two!
-->

<!-- 
AI AGENT INSTRUCTIONS - READ THIS FIRST:

This is a UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE that adapts to ANY platform (Replit, Lovable, AWS, local, etc.).

CRITICAL: You are documenting the DEVELOPMENT environment, NOT the production/deployed environment.

WHAT TO DO:
1. Run the COMPREHENSIVE DISCOVERY SEQUENCE below to detect your platform
2. Test EVERY command in your actual environment
3. Replace ALL [bracketed] placeholders in this file with real values
4. Update this existing `environment_context.md` file directly with the completed content
5. Document platform-specific tools, limitations, and workflows
6. Verify all commands work before finalizing

CRITICAL DISCOVERY SEQUENCE:
Run these commands first to identify your platform and capabilities:
```bash
# ENVIRONMENT TYPE CHECK - RUN THIS FIRST!

echo ""
echo "⚠️ CONFIRMING: I am documenting the DEVELOPMENT workspace, not production"
echo "=== END ENVIRONMENT CHECK ==="

```

ENHANCED INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT guess commands - test everything
- Do NOT leave any [brackets] in the final file
- Document ALL platform-specific tools, workflows, and limitations
- If a standard tool doesn't work, find and document the platform-specific alternative
- Pay special attention to process management, package installation, and deployment workflows
- This document will be your ONLY reference for this environment
- CRITICAL: Distinguish between development preview URLs and production deployed URLs

[Document full reset procedure, e.g.:]
# For Replit: use restart button (affects dev only)
# For Docker: docker-compose down && docker-compose up
# For local: manual cleanup and restart
# Current method: [actual method]

# Partial recovery
[Document partial recovery, e.g.:]
# Clear cache: [platform-specific cache clearing]
# Restart services: [platform-specific service restart]
# Current method: [actual method]

# NOTE: These procedures affect DEVELOPMENT only
```

## 15. Quick Reference Card

```bash
# DEVELOPMENT Environment Quick Commands:
[List the most important commands for this platform]

# Essential workflow:
1. Always work in DEVELOPMENT environment
2. Test using local_dev_preview URL: [actual URL]
3. Deploy to production using: [deployment method]
4. Production URL (DO NOT use for testing): [prod URL]

# Emergency commands:
[Document emergency procedures]

# Platform-specific reminders:
[List critical platform-specific rules]

# Environment check:
echo "Current environment: DEVELOPMENT"
echo "Preview URL: [local_dev_preview]"
echo "Production URL (DO NOT USE): [public_deployed_app]"
```

## 16. Environment Verification

Run this final check to confirm correct environment documentation:

```bash
echo "=== FINAL ENVIRONMENT VERIFICATION ==="
echo "Environment type: DEVELOPMENT"
echo "Preview/test URL: [local_dev_preview URL]"
echo "Production URL (reference only): [public_deployed_app URL or 'Not deployed']"
echo ""
echo "✓ I will use [local_dev_preview URL] for ALL testing"
echo "✓ I understand [public_deployed_app URL] is production"
echo "✓ This profile documents the DEVELOPMENT environment"
echo "=== VERIFICATION COMPLETE ==="
```

_End of Universal Environment Context Profile_

<!-- 
FINAL CHECKLIST FOR AI AGENT:
- [ ] Updated existing `environment_context.md` file in place
- [ ] Ran comprehensive discovery sequence
- [ ] Clearly identified this as DEVELOPMENT environment
- [ ] Tested every single command
- [ ] Replaced ALL [bracketed] placeholders
- [ ] Documented BOTH development and production URLs
- [ ] Made clear which URL to use for testing
- [ ] Documented platform-specific features and limitations
- [ ] Verified file updated correctly in original location
- [ ] No [brackets] remain in document
- [ ] All commands produce expected output
- [ ] Platform-specific workflows documented
- [ ] Error recovery procedures tested

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
✅ Platform correctly identified and documented
✅ Development vs production clearly distinguished
✅ Both URLs documented with clear usage instructions
✅ All platform-specific tools and workflows captured
✅ No generic assumptions - everything tested
✅ Another AI agent could operate effectively using this profile
✅ Emergency procedures documented and tested
✅ Agent knows to use local_dev_preview for ALL testing

This profile now serves as the definitive reference for this specific DEVELOPMENT environment.
